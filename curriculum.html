  <h1>Enhancing the Introductory Course</h1>
  <li>Additions: instilling confidence, emphasizing community, showing breadth of CS applications
  <li>Make the course accessible by those without any prior experience (guys more likely to have had prior experience)
  <li>Emphasize value of hard work and organization
  <li>Use applications beyond just current popular technologies (that guys might be more likely to have used before)
  <li>Undergrad TAs (40% women, because women understand the significance of mentoring other women)
  <li>Community building for a more welcoming environment
  <li>Early exposure (K-12, freshman year), encouraging women to try it - because many women didn’t know it was an option for them

  <a name = "unit1"><h1>Unit 1: Fundamentals</h1></a>
  <li>Interactive lectures, computer-based activities and assessments, pair programming, iterative programming, step-by-step demos, discussions, interactive practice (code alongs)

  (insert examples of these kinds of lessons)

  <li>Supportive learning environment – ensure students of all abilities are engaged, focus on explaining topics thoroughly, which is especially important for students who struggle early on (avoid alienating/overlooking these students)
  <li>Environment of patience and constant evaluation on student success

  <h2>Why start off with Scratch, a drag-and-drop program?</h2>
    <li>Prevent disengagement, how students first feel impacts their resilience and attitude toward subject

    <li>Introduce students to fundamentals
    <li>Build confidence
    <li>Gives students opportunities to see results in the beginning
    <li>Downside: students were frustrated on first day of Python because it felt like they were backtracking

  <h3>On starting off the program with Scratch, in the girls’ own words…</h3>
  <div class = "quotes">
    I was glad that we started with Scratch and animations because it was simple and showed what code can do to things on a screen. - GS
  </div>

  <h2>Provide students with a new definition of computer science, and help them realize how they fit into this definition</h2>
    <li>Successes of multidisciplinary approach to defining computer science:
    <li>Reframes intro experience from discipline specific to tackling real world questions across multiple disciplines
    <li>Collaborative/interdisciplinary

    <li>Most students came in admitting that they didn’t know exactly how to define computer science, so we were able to give them our definition right from the beginning
    <li>Other students came in with preconceptions, and we wanted to debunk a lot of those myths right off the bat

  <h3>On new understandings of computer science, in the girls’ own words… </h3>
  <div class = "quotes">
    At the beginning of the week I thought that CS was an untouchable subject, one that was too difficult to begin with and too difficult to even approach. This week though, I became aware that it’s not too difficult to start, even if it begins with a kid’s game online. I have learned to create games and I am able to recall parts of programming that I wouldn’t have known if I weren’t here. Computer Science as a career seems like a viable option and my worries about its complex parts are diminishing. - GJ
    <br><br>
    My understanding of computer science has changed since I started the summer immersion program because I didn’t realize the amount of cooperation and group work that might be necessary and beneficial in computer science. I always thought that people who worked on computer science did it alone, but as we worked on projects this week, I realized that even computer science could be easier and more effective when we worked together. - AD
    <br><br>
    My understanding of CS for me has changed to a huge variety of principles and activities involving computers. There are so many things that people do involving computer science like building video games, creating movies, editing movies or TV shows, and building apps and websites. Computer science is the future of our world because technology is always being revolutionized. - GS
  </div>

  <h2>Make changes based on student feedback</h2>
  <br><i>Muller, C. L., & Kidd, C. (2014). Debugging geographers: Teaching programming to non-computer scientists. Journal of Geography in Higher Education, 38(2), 175-192. doi:10.1080/03098265.2014.908275</i>

  <li>Feedback from reading the mood of the class and reading the girls’ journals
  <li>Important to take time to discover student learning styles early on (a long term investment)
  <li>Takes a leap of faith to give the class the kind of control to let us know when lessons are not working for them
  <li>Requires humility to apologize to the class and admit that we didn’t get it right the first time
  <li>Requires extra time and dedication to rework a lesson, rather than just pushing on

  <p>
    We had the girls submit journals at the end of every day, which is beneficial to both them and us. It gave the girls the opportunity to reflect on their day - some questions we believe were most beneficial to the students were asking what they were most proud of figuring out that day and what they saw another student do that they were impressed with. As a teaching team, we found feedback about lessons extremely valuable. While we generally had a good read on the class during the lessons, the additional explanations of how students felt the lessons went were very helpful, especially in moments where students were very open and brutally honest. We tried to show students that their opinions were valuable by implementing changes in the lessons based on their suggestion. We believe this ultimately created a learning environment where students could trust that every activity we did had purpose and was in their interest.
    <br><br>
    We found that it typically takes the girls about ten minutes to write in their journals. We never wanted them to feel rushed, so we tried to leave the last fifteen minutes of class for their journals. We also gave girls the option to write their journals on their way home, which gave girls who rode the bus a fifteen minute window to walk to the bus stop and catch their bus. We appreciated the responsibility of the girls who rode the bus for responding to the journals as soon as they had the chance, and were glad to help make their commute home faster and less stressful.
    <br><br>
    One big change we made to the curriculum was after the first lesson of Python, which was very difficult for the girls. Taking time to read the girls’ feedback allowed for us to design a lesson that was better suited to their needs. After this lesson, their journals were crucial in showing us how our lesson was received. In this case, knowing that we had succeeded allowed us to confidently move on in the curriculum and reuse these strategies when reworking future lessons.

  <h3>On Day 6 (the first day of learning Python), in the girls’ own words… </h3>
  <div class = "quotes">
    Python is really hard and I was so lost while everyone else was coding. I wish there was more time to understand it or if there was more help because a lot of girls where confused at the same time. With Scratch there were a lot of examples and I felt that with Python, Girls Who Code didn’t give a lot practice problems and so once we got to the challenges, I was completely lost on what exactly we were doing. I hope tomorrow we are given more practice and time to fully digest the code. - AW
    <br><br>
    I am proud of figuring out nothing tbh. I do not recall anything I did today honestly except watching the thrilling shane dawson saga that came out during lunch... The fact that I was able to perform mathematical operations was probably the most interesting thing. The projects will help me one day, be able to understand python… p.s. so now i'm at the bus stop and i see that my initial comments were a bit harsh and pessimistic. i was very excited to start with python today and i am very glad that i was able to at least print “hello, world!” which i think i once heard was the first thing people code. i liked working with others, who were just as eager to learn. i am putting the difficult moments of today aside and trying to learn today at home so that i can prepare for tomorrow. - GJ
    <br><br>
    Today the only thing I was proud of is was Archie’s mom in Riverdale when she cussed him out pretty much about being a traitor. Everything about Python was hard. Very hard. I understood why everything worked with other things, but once it came to writing the code it made no sense. I didn’t know where to start. - SL
  </div>

  <h3>On Day 7 (the second day of learning Python), in the girls’ own words…</h3>
  <div class = "quotes">
    I felt a lot better about Python today, and the review helped a lot. The lists were a bit confusing, but tomorrow I will have more time to fully understand everything about them. - AW
    <br><br>
    I loveddddd [sic] how everything went down today. I finally understand what we learned in python and I’m 100% comfortable with it. Okay maybe not 100%, but it’ll get there. - SL
    <br><br>
    I thought today’s review was helpful because it helped me have a better understanding of the concepts we learned yesterday. I feel comfortable with the concepts we have learned so far. - KG
    <br><br>
    The review this morning was helpful in cementing some of the vocabulary for Python, but as we move forward I feel like independent review will benefit me most. I was not comfortable with everything we learned today, but as the first time seeing it, it’s fine. - KC
    <br><br>
    I would definitly [sic] say that the review we did today was very helpful. This is because yesterday I didn’t really actually know how to do the stuff we went over, but today after reviewing the information again now I feel comfortable with it. - GK
    <br><br>
    I do feel more comfortable using python [sic] because I actually got the adventure to work and it was much easier than the first day. I feel more comfortable. I was very proud of finishing the project and I’m very happy because I helped some of my group members and they helped me. - GP

  <a name = "unit2"><h1>Unit 2: Applications (Robotics, Web Development, Data Science)</h1></a>

  <h2>The practicality of real world applications</h2>
    <li>Use relevant examples and analogies to explain

    <br><i>Muller, C. L., & Kidd, C. (2014). Debugging geographers: Teaching programming to non-computer scientists. Journal of Geography in Higher Education, 38(2), 175-192. doi:10.1080/03098265.2014.908275</i>

  <h2>Real world applications as incentives to learn computer science </h2>
    <li>Coding is a difficult skill to learn that requires a considerable investment of thought, practice, and motivation, so content and context of courses important to consider especially if students are not already convinced they want to learn it and to bring coding outside of the CS major

    <br><i>Cooper, Jennifer and Dierker, Lisa, "Increasing Exposure to Programming: A Comparison of Demographic Characteristics of Students Enrolled in Introductory Computer Science Programming Courses vs. A Multidisciplinary Data Analysis Course" (2017). Faculty Scholarship. 4. http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/psycfacpub/4</i>

    <li>Some students already know they want to code, but otherwise need some kind of incentive to draw students in
    <li>Recognize that some students really want to learn to code, others just want to see what they can do with code

  <h3>On what they were initially most excited to learn, in the girls’ own words… </h3>
  <div class = "quotes">
    I’m most excited to learn about Python, as I want to get a strong grasp on these basic programming languages. I am excited since programming languages are what I want to excel in, so this will be a nice introduction for me. - LC
    <br><br>
    Since I pretty much have no previous coding or programming experience, I am really excited to learn about everything and don’t have anything specific that I am looking forward to. Overall, I am taking this program as a way to get my feet wet with the computer science field itself, simply to see whether or not it is something that I could pursue. - AD
    <br><br>
    I’m most excited to learn how to code robots. I think this is really excited because at this point it’s not only coding a small video or something theoretical, but it’s actually coding something that will show results physically as well. - LS
    <br><br>
    I’m most excited to learn how to make a website. It’s something I’ve always wanted to know how to do and I can’t wait. I’m also just excited to learn how to code in general but making a website sounds really exciting. - LO
    <br><br>
    I am most excited to learn more about how computer science is used in the real world. - GK

  <a name = "unit3"><h1>Unit 3: Final Projects</h1></a>

  <h2>Students get to make a project of their design</h2>
    <li>Motivated by opportunity to answer their own applied research questions an/or fulfill major requirement
    <li>Intrinsic motivation particularly motivating for female students

    <li>While there were projects that accompanied each lesson, students got to have more control over this project and invest one and a half weeks into it
    <li>A project the girls knew inside out, felt was representative of their abilities and passions, and were proud of
