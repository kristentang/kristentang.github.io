<h1>Case Study: An In Depth Look at Curriculum for APIs</h1>

<h2>Why did I choose this lesson for an in depth look?</h2>
  <li>Very important concept
  <li>One of the lessons the teaching team reworked for our class and involved a lot tough decision making for us, so I can explain the reasoning behind our decisions
  <li>3/5 projects ended up using APIs, which I believe is a fairly high rate of groups incorporating it

<h3>On the significance of the Women in Tech spotlight, in the girls’ own words…</h3>
<div class = "quotes">
  The women in tech spotlight has exposed me to more opportunities for not only women in tech, but tech in general. - KC
  <br><br>
  Kim Swift makes really interesting video games like Quantum Conundrum. I saw a video where she explains how QUantum Conundrum works and it sounds SO cool. I think it would be so much fun to make games like that. - LO
  <br><br>
  The video games that Kim Swift made excited me the most since we also got to make some sort of video game today. I might want to make a longer video game myself after learning about Kim Swift. - AD
  <br><br>
  The lady from women in tech spotlight, Marieme Jamme is sooo amazing!!! She was really inspiring to read about. - KC
  <br><br>
  What I liked best about today was learning about Lovelace and getting to start playing around with Scratch. I never knew that the first programmer was a woman! - GS

<a name = "#36"><h1>(3) How to Use an API and (6) API Project - Build & Test</h1></a>

  <h2>(include examples of code along - show lack of explanations)</h2>

  <h2>Why this lesson was difficult: </h2>

  <p>
    The girls seemed to really like the HTML, CSS, and JS lessons, and were able to create so amazing websites. The one lesson that was difficult for the girls was the API lesson. I think APIs are incredibly useful and I’m glad they are included in the curriculum, but I think the lesson was too difficult for our girls to follow. Code alongs have been very helpful for our girls to learn new information, however the code provided by the curriculum did not have very clear explanation of the new additions to the code.
    <br><br>
    The lesson also incorporated HTML and JS, which are new concepts to the girls. This added an additional layer to the lesson because the girls had to not only apply a brand new concept, but also do so in a language they are still familiarizing themselves with. This is where clear explanations would have really helped the girls. Because there were so much content, it also would have been nice to differentiate between the concepts/code that the girls had already learned, were related to APIs, and JS code that was new.
    <br><br>
    We ended the lesson early because we could tell (from observing them during the lessons and reading their journals) the students were lost and frustrated. Most of the girls ended up copying and pasting from the provided github code, and expressed in their journals how they felt like they did not get much out of doing so, even if they were able to get their code to work.

<h2>Describe the activity</h2>

<br><br>

<p>
  When we ended the lesson, we wanted to give the girls time to decompress, so we didn’t want to force them to keep thinking about APIs. Instead, we gave them time to continue working on the websites they had been making for the past two days.
  We knew this concept of the lesson was important, and we knew that when we recreated the lesson we would want to include a similar activity.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of the day, we took first took time to apologize to the girls for not being as prepared as we should have been. We let them know that we believed the lesson was too complex for a beginner lesson, and that had we been more familiar with the lesson, we should have recognized this earlier on.
  <br><br>
  We knew what kind of feedback we would be receiving from the girls in their journals. This was not the first time that we had gotten negative feedback, and from similar experiences, such as during the first Python lesson, we were not scared of the negative feedback because we knew we could rework the lesson.

<h3>Answering “How did you feel about the lessons on Web Dev?” in the girls’ own words…</h3>
<div class = "quotes">
  I liked learning about websites but it was difficult to figure out how to do stuff that I wanted. Like, sure I know how to change the background color but that’s not what im [sic] trying to do. I endedup [sic] just like copy pasting most of my code so the final result was cool but i [sic] don’t know if I felt that accomplished from it. Also, <color>I don’t know how I feel about API’s</color>. It was hard to follow and i don’t understand what was going on. - Student Lauren
  <br><br>
  Overall I enjoyed the Web Dev lessons because they were fun and allowed me to be creative. <color>The only lesson that I didn’t like was the API lesson</color>. I felt that the concepts were abstract and hard to understand and that the map project was hard to follow. - Student B
  <br><br>
  I have been told before that the beginning of CS is all about copying, pasting, and just going with the flow of a class/program/etc. to get by as we begin learning, <color>but going back to this weeks API lesson, I did not enjoy the activity</color>. The code along was much too long, and the majority of the code was new and unfamiliar - ultimately remaining unexplained. Despite this, I hope the lesson on Monday will be more enjoyable. - Student C
  <br><br>
  I found the lessons on WebDev to be helpful. <color>I did not like trying to make APIs</color> because I was confused. - Student D
  <br><br>
  The webdev lessons were informative but slightly lacking. <color>I did not particularly enjoy the lesson on APIs</color> because it was confusing on many levels and we were just copying code that we did not understand. - Student E
  <br><br>
  WebDev was so much fun! It wasn’t hard to figure everything out and I feel like it was really rewarding. - Student F
  <br><br>
  <color>I did not like the lesson of the APIs</color>, but the rest was good. I liked building the website and it was pretty fun. - Student G

<a name ="second"><h1>The Teaching Team's Lesson</h1></a>

<p>
  While we never ended up doing the API project, there are so many possibilities that I knew our girls would have had fun with it if they had been more comfortable with APIs. While there were other projects or parts of lessons that we never had time to finish and understanding APIs was not critical to move on with the rest of the curriculum, we felt it was important to reteach this lesson because we felt like it is such a useful topic to know. We didn’t want the girls to leave feeling defeated by a topic and scared of incorporating it into their final project or intimidated of learning it in the future. I believe this paid off, seeing as three out of five teams incorporated APIs into their final project.
  <br><br>
  (describe different aspects of this lesson - main aspect was starting with a much smaller goal, breaking down explanation step by step, code along - had to accept a much smaller end product, also we made the lesson so we were comfortable with the code and weren’t learning it along with them - had to admit that we were not as prepared as we should have been)

<h3>Answering “What are you most proud of accomplishing today?” and “How have you shown that you are intellectually curious?” in the girls’ own words… </h3>
<div class  = "quotes">
  I am most proud of getting the chatroom to work even if we still have room to improve it. I’m looking forward to being able to make it work on two computers so other people can talk on it… I think I was intellectually curious when we kept on looking for the right API and when things went wrong, we still looked for a way to fix it. - LS
