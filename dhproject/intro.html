<h1>Essential Questions of the Project</h1>
<p1>
  1. How do you make coding curriculum more accessible to high school students and non-computer science college students?
  <br>
  2. How did particular lesson elements impact our students' interest, understanding, and confidence in programming?
  <br>
  3. How did we adapt the curriculum to best fit the needs of our students?

    <h1>Why Girls Who Code?</h1>
    <p>

      <br><br><h2>Programming increasingly used in less traditionally computer oriented occupations</h2>
      <li>Underrepresentation of females and individuals from racial minorities
      <li>Widen access for students from all educational, social, and economic backgrounds
      <li>Disparities in both leadership and technical roles
      <li>Leaky pipeline

Faculty Scholarship. 4. http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/psycfacpub/4</i>

      <br><br><h2>Make Companies More Well-Rounded, and Therefore Stronger</h2>
      <li>Biggest reason for increasing representation of women in the workforce is a greater quality of solutions/products that can be created by a team of diverse contributors
      <li>Engineering has a large (often overlooked) creative aspect
      <li>Don’t want to limit the types of experiences/backgrounds/POVs that can be applied to a problem

      <br><br><h2>Approach closing the gender gap by changing the way girls view computer science</h2>
        <li> Important to make coding accessible to females because of lack of female representation in the field
        <li>24% of computer scientists are female
        <li>Biggest drop-off in interest in computer science occurs in middle and high school
        <li>Using technology to solve problems and fulfill a vision for a better world
        <li>Empower girls with skills and confidence to enter and succeed
        <li>Project-based curriculum
        <li>Connecting girls to a community of other female computer scientists - peers and role models

      <br><br><h2>2012 Girls Who Code founded by Reshma Saujani</h2>
        <li>Girls Who Code current impact
        <li>Various programs reach over 90,000 girls in all 50 states
        <li>College-aged alumni are pursuing higher education in computer science related fields at a rate of 15 times the national average

    <h1>Why Digital Humanities?</h1>

    <p>
      <br><br><h2>Digital Humanities: </h2><br><br>
        <li>Study, exploration, and preservation of, as well as education about, human cultures, events, languages, people, and material production in the past and present in a digital environment for scholars, students, and the general public
        <li>Digital Environment: the creation and use of dynamic tools
        <li>Purpose: to visualize and analyze data, share and annotate primary sources, discuss and publish findings, and collaborate on research and teaching
        <li>Using computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional to the humanities
        <li>Asking traditional kinds of humanities-oriented questions about computing technologies
        <li>Digital Scholarship: tern instead of DH because it is a multi-disciplinary field (collaboration of participants from various backgrounds)
        <li>Connect, engage, build
        <li>DH methods and tools inform the work of humanities students

<h1>Why are approaches toward coding curriculum for high school girls and digital humanities students similar?</h1>
<p>
  <h2>Teaching students with no background</h2>
    <li>Improving an introductory module in computer programming and data analysis (an advanced beginner – someone who is comfortable with what they have learned and understand it well enough that they could continue to find ways to apply their knowledge to novel situations; understanding how to use what they have learned; basic problem solving skills and ability to know how to keep learning)
    <li>Curriculum a result of merging computer science with pedagogy
    <li>Consider the context of the students and develop relevant skills
