    <h1>The Impact of Curriculum that Enhances and Diversifies Introductory Programming Courses</h1>

    <p>Throughout my time as a teaching assistant, I was able to witness several qualities of the Girls Who Code curriculum. These qualities revealed themselves in the specifics of what was being taught, how it was being taught, and the teaching philosophies that inspired the classroom culture. I recognized how these qualities had also been described by digital humanities scholars as characterisitcs that are important in teaching introductory coding to undergraduate digital humanities students.

    <h2>Introductory Curriculum is Successful When it...</h2>

    <h5>Instills confidence<black>: Successful introductory curriculum shows students that they have be ability to learn the material, apply it to projects, and take on challenges </black> <a href = "resources.html" target = "_blank">(Eney et al. 49)</a><black>.</black></h5><br>
    <h5>Creates a supportive community<black>: Successful introductory curriculum provides students with a productive, supportive, comfortable, and diverse learning environment. This kind of environment is created by both classmates and instructors who can serve as role models and mentors </black> <a href = "resources.html" target = "_blank">(Eney et al. 49)</a><black>.</black></h5><br>
    <h5>Redefines computer science<black>: Successful introductory curriculum expands the definition of computer science.

    <h5>Is accessible to those without prior background<black>: Successful introductory curriculum respects and celebrates to the diversity of its students' backgrounds and adapts to keep all its students on the same page </black> <a href = "resources.html" target = "_blank">(Eney et al. 49)</a><black>.</black></h5><br>
    <h5>Emphasizes the value of hard work, organization, and resilience<black>: Successful introductory curriculum shows students that some "esoteric knowledge of currently popular technologies or some innate gift" they fear they don't have are not the greatest indicators of success. Instead, lessons and projects should point students towards the importance of hard work, organization, and resilience </black> <a href = "resources.html" target = "_blank">(Eney et al. 49)</a><black>.</black></h5><br>
    <h5>Encourages creativity and discovery<black>: Successful introductory curriculum doesn't necessarily introduce all the "detailed mechanisms of computing" before giving them a tast to complete. Instead, letting them try new things and piece together what they do know allows them to see programming "as a means of inquiry" toward a solution </black> <a href = "resources.html" target = "_blank">(Montfort 108)</a><black>.</black></h5><br>
    <h5>Constantly evaluates student progress and success<black>: Successful introductory curriculum uses student evaluations to assess the success of lessons and implements this feedback in the future </black> <a href = "resources.html" target = "_blank">(Muller & Kidd 184)</a><black>.</black></h5><br>
    <h5>Allows students to learn by doing<black>: Successful introductory curriculum teaches fundamentals in a way that allows students to engage and participate in creating code, rather than only watching someone else </black> <a href = "resources.html" target = "_blank">(Cooper & Dierker 97)</a><black>.</black></h5><br>

    <li>The teaching team defined computer science, reframing their expectations and exciting them about what they would learn during the summer.
    <li>For students who came in admitting that they didn’t exactly know how to define computer science, we were able to give them a definition right from the beginning. 
    <li>For students who came in with preconceptions, we were able to debunk myths and eliminate stereotypes from the start. 
    <li>The teaching team expanded the definition of computer science by introducing students to computer scientists and examples of computer science projects, as described by our students below.

        "My understanding of CS for me has changed to a huge variety of principles and activities involving computers. There are so many things that people do involving computer science like building video games, creating movies, editing movies or TV shows, and building apps and websites. Computer science is the future of our world because technology is always being revolutionized." - GS
      </p>
    </div>

    <li>Students started to see themselves as computer scientists.

    <div class = "quotes">
      <h3>On new understandings of computer science, <br>in their own words… </h3>
      <p>
        "My understanding of computer science has changed since I started the summer immersion program [<i>sic</i>] because I didn’t realize the amount of cooperation and group work that might be necessary and beneficial in computer science. I always thought that people who worked on computer science did it alone, but as we worked on projects this week, I realized that even computer science could be easier and more effective when we worked together." - AD

    <h2>Four Days of Curriculum </h2>
    <p>
      For every week, only four days of curriculum were planned. This built in time for field trips, guest speakers, and flexibility in the length of lessons.
    </p>

    <h5>Create a supportive community <a href = "resources.html" target = "_blank">(Eney et al. 49)</a></h5>
    <li>Students learned from women who use technology in their jobs.

        At Womentoring, different women from Warner Bros. came and shared their stories. Some participated by rotating through the tables and others by being part of a panel. The women took this mentoring opportunity to share their personal stories, answer questions, and pass on advice. At the end of the day, they came back to the classroom and our girls showed them their websites. The girls proudly showed off their work to women they respected,  who were genuinely interested in, supportive of, and impressed with what they had worked on that week.

    <a name = "unit1"></a>
    <h1>Unit 1: Fundamentals</h1>

    <p>
      Unit 1 has the students begin to learn the fundamentals of programming through Scratch, a drag-and-drop program with a user-friendly interface, and Python. These fundamentals include variables, loops, conditionals, functions, libraries, lists, and the concept of iterative design. Additionally, computer science is defined as using technology to solve problems. They are shown many examples of applications of computer science and computer scientists. Students begin to consider how their unique characteristics can play out in the field of computer science, a theme that is continually reinforced and evolving throughout the summer.

      <p>
        "Python is really hard and I was so lost while everyone else was coding. I wish there was more time to understand it or if there was more help because a lot of girls where confused at the same time. With Scratch there were a lot of examples and I felt that with Python, Girls Who Code didn’t give a lot practice problems and so once we got to the challenges, I was completely lost on what exactly we were doing. I hope tomorrow we are given more practice and time to fully digest the code." - AW

        "I am proud of figuring out nothing tbh [<i>sic</i>]. I do not recall anything I did today honestly except watching the thrilling shane dawson saga [<i>sic</i>] that came out during lunch... The fact that I was able to perform mathematical operations was probably the most interesting thing. The projects will help me one day, be able to understand python [<i>sic</i>]… p.s. [<i>sic</i>] so now I'm at the bus stop and I see that my initial comments were a bit harsh and pessimistic. I was very excited to start with python today and i am very glad that i was able to at least print “hello, world!” which I think I once heard was the first thing [<i>sic</i>] people code. I liked working with others, who were just as eager to learn. I am putting the difficult moments of today aside and trying to learn today at home so that I can prepare for tomorrow." - GJ

        "Today the only thing I was proud of is was [<i>sic</i>] Archie’s mom in Riverdale when she cussed him out pretty much about being a traitor. Everything about Python was hard. Very hard. I understood why everything worked with other things, but once it came to writing the code it made no sense. I didn’t know where to start." - SL

    <li>This required humility from the teaching team to apologize to the class and admit when we didn’t get things right the first time. 
    <li>The teaching team's responses formed student-teacher relationships built on honesty and trust. 
    <li>This required extra time and dedication to rework a lesson, rather than just pushing on. This ultimately paid off, as suggested by feedback we received after reworking and reteaching the original Python lesson.

    <h1>Unit 3: Final Projects</h1>

    <p>
      In Unit 3, students use what they learned over the course of the summer to build a final project that addresses a real world problem. Students get experience using the iterative design-build-test cycle over the course of a large project, learning how to manage their time, stay organized, and respond and adjust to feedback. Students then create posters and pitches to present at graduation.

As data is so robust and difficult to analyze, it was created from the belief that visual representations make understanding statistics simpler and give insight to how much the environment is negatively impacted by bad air quality. One main feature is graphs of the Air Quality Index (AQI) of sample states, California, New York, Hawaii, created by analyzing data from the Environmental Protection Agency (<a href = "https://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank" id ="lightpink_small">EPA.gov</a>) and making graphs in Python. A second major feature is an interactive map of the US that reveals the AQI of each state capital. </p>

It was created from the realization that as time progresses and society changes, it is important to help eliminate the lack of awareness of micraogressions and inform people on how they are discriminatory actions that fail to treat everyone justly and equally. Its main features include explanations of what microaggresions are and FAQs about them, a page of stories, an interactive quiz, a simulation game created in Scratch, and a Resources Page. </p>
