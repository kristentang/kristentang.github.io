      <p>
        This project used the Natural Language Tookkit (NLTK) sentiment analysis function to analyze text sentiment of four csv datasets (Amazon product reviews, beer reviews, movie reviews, and umbrella reviews). Each dataset contains a list of pairs of review content and a numeric rating. The correlation between the  user-generated ratings and NLTK-generated scores were plotted in a matplotlib bar graph. I also found wrote code to find words uniquely associated with positive and negative sentiment scores.

    <p>
      An experiment on change blindness, the perceptual phenomenon of not noticing a change in a visual stimulus. A common example of this phenomenon is when an observer overlooks a major difference in two versions of the same image as it rapidly alternates between the two. In this experiment, we studied how they type of stimuli and it's distance from an observer's gaze would affect the observer's accuracy and response time in finding a changing stimuli. We were interested in knowing if the percieved salience of certain aspects of an image would distract the observer from catching a change in the stimuli.
