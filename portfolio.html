            <p>
              A website displaying analysis of drone wars data from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, to identify spatial, temporal, and empirical shifts in the United Stateâ€™s use of drone campaigns. We are striving to make interpretation of drone warfare data more accessible and transparent by adding maps and visualizations representing qualitative analysis to the political, geographical, humanitarian, and legal contexts of drone warfare.

          <h2>Change Blindness Experiment</h2>
          <p>
            An experiment on change blindness, the perceptual phenomenon of not noticing a change in a visual stimulus. A common example of this phenomenon is when an observer overlooks a major difference in two versions of the same image as it rapidly alternates between the two. In this experiment, we studied how they type of stimuli and it's distance from an observer's gaze would affect the observer's accuracy and response time in finding a changing stimuli. We were interested in knowing if the percieved salience of certain aspects of an image would distract the observer from catching a change in the stimuli.

          <h2>Girls Who Code Student Final Projects</h2>
          <p>
            Working with two other teachers, I constantly collaborated and discussed both strategies for effective classroom management and creating a supportive culture and environment, as well as how to best teach programming skills to beginners. This culminated in the facilitation of the final group projects, which represented the skills and concepts the girls learned through the program.
