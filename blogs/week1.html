<h1>Why Girls Who Code?</h1>

<div class = "BlogText">

  <p>The field of technology is among the fastest growing job market in the US, yet the percentage of women in the field is shrinking.
    In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women, and today it has shrunk to 24%. The biggest drop-off in interest in computer science occurs in middle school and high school when girls are between the ages of 13 and 17, much before a woman selects her college major or begins her first job. </p>

  <p>In 2012, Reshma Saujani founded Girls Who Code to address this gender gap by changing the way girls view computer science.
    She wanted girls to see computer scientists as more than just people capable of writing code, but people who use technology to solve problems and fulfill a vision for a better world.
    In the male-dominated field of computer science, there is a desperate need to empower girls with the skills and confidence to enter and succeed. Girls Who Code was created to encourage girls to pursue computer science by teaching them coding skills through a project-based curriculum, demonstrating real-world applications of computer science, and connecting them to a community of other female computer scientists including both peers and role models.
    Today, Girls Who Code has grown to reach over 90,000 girls in all 60 states through various types of programs, and its college-aged alumni are pursuing higher education in computer science related fields at a rate of 15 times the national average. </p>


  <p>This summer, I am a TA for Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion Program at Warner Bros., a 7 week long program for girls entering eleventh and twelfth grade with little or no coding experience.
    The curriculum begins with introductory concepts in coding, covers applications of computer science, including robots, web development and data science, and culminates with girls working on a final project for the last two weeks.
    Girls Who Code and our partner company provide our class with field trips, guest speakers, and workshops to show girls practical and relevant applications of technology and allow girls to learn from females currently in computer science fields. </p>

  <p>I am majoring in cognitive science, as wanting to be a teacher attracted me to its interdisciplinary approach to studying how we think and learn.
    Through cognitive science, I found myself in my first programming courses. The more classes I took, the more intrigued I became in the possibilities of what I could create.
    I enjoyed the challenge of developing my troubleshooting, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity skills.
    I found Girls Who Code because I recognized the importance of these skills and this field, and love to teach what I am passionate about.
    I believe it is invaluable to invest in the potential students have to grow and succeed in their education. Opening doors for them and mentoring them on their way through are some of my biggest motivations for wanting to be a teacher. I believe Girls Who Code inspires students, as it provides relevant and engaging ways to begin developing coding skills and pursue fields related to computer science in college and as a career.</p>

  <p>My teaching team's goal is to build a supportive and collaborative environment that equips our students with the skills, resources, and inspiration to pursue higher education and careers in technology-related fields.
    Personally, I also hope that my time as a TA and experience with Girls Who Code and Warner Bros. helps me develop a deeper and more holistic understanding how technology can impact society. </p>

  <p>This week, I have already gotten to see my students become comfortable with the concepts of algorithms, variables, loops, and conditionals.
    I am proud of the determination and resilience they showed in learning Scratch, a drag-and-drop coding program.
    By the end of the week, they had completed an All About Me, dance competition, Choose Your Own Adventure, and maze project!
    We were fortunate for the fun and class bonding from seeing Ocean's 8 and touring Stage 48 together.
    Most importantly, I was able to witness how honesty, compassion, and respect cultivated a supportive classroom environment throughout the week. I am already so proud of these girls, and cannot wait for the rest of the summer!</p>
