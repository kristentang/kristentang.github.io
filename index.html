<h3>About Me</h3>
<div class = "text_block">
    <p>I am a fourth year Cognitive Science major (specialization in computing) and <a href = "http://dh.ucla.edu/undergraduate-minor/">Digital Humanities minor at UCLA</a>. Outside of the classroom, I am also involved in the Bruin Ambassador Program (visiting schools in the Los Angeles area and presenting information about UCLA, college, and the application process), Cub Tours (giving campus tours to elementary and middle school students), and Bruins Fighting Pediatric Cancer. In my free time, I love cooking and baking (and eating!), watching Friends, being outdoors, and napping.</p>

<h3>About My Summer</h3>
<div class = "text_block">
    <p>This summer I will be a TA for the <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/">Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</a> at Warner Brothers in Burbank.
      It is a 7 week program for incoming 11th and 12th grade girls, that encourages them to pursue computer science by teaching them coding skills through a project based curriculum and demonstrating real-world applications of computer science.
      I will be part of a teaching team whose goal is to teach the curriculum and manage our classroom, encourage and mentor the students, and build a supportive and collaborative learning environment.
      I have experience programming in C++, Matlab, Java, and Python.
      While I haven't had any formal classroom experience in web development, I made this website as preparation for TAing the Summer Immersion Program.
      Stay tuned, I will be using this website to <a href="blog.html">blog my experience </a> weekly!</p>
